# yasma - yet another social media app ðŸ™„

## Overview
We've all found ourselves scrolling endlessly on social media and before you know it, you check the clock and 3 hours has already passed. You're left blurry eyed and numb, with half your day gone. I decided to explore this phenomenon by using programmatic art to mimic this experience.yasma, otherwise known as 'yet another social media app' is a faux social media  web app that uses creative coding to represent the endless scrolling of social media. Once the user signs in, they are met with their home feed, but instead of regular posts, the web app features hypnotic and anxiety inducing patterns.
